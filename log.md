# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 7, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: began work on Django API, worked on url routiung and framework for the app. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with debugging the API not recognizing the rest_framework module, but, overall, I feel like I am getting better at pushing through hurddles. Django is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. Looking forward to diving deeper into Django and geting the API up and running.
