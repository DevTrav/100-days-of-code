# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 7, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: began work on Django API, worked on url routiung and framework for the app. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with debugging the API not recognizing the rest_framework module, but, overall, I feel like I am getting better at pushing through hurddles. Django is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. Looking forward to diving deeper into Django and geting the API up and running.

### Day 1: August 8, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: Debugged url.py routing issues in Django API, learned new testing technique using views.py to confirm new apps(API in my case) and main app url.py routes are working together. Also, I created a new repo for Exercism algo solutions and pushed my local Excercism install as the initial commit. I also honed some clean git flow for when you need to blowup a local repo and reflect the remote repo upstream --> git reset --hard origin/main. Then, clean untracked files in the local repo with --> git clean -xdf. Very handy.

**Thoughts:** I am really proud that I pushed through the discomfort of struggling with debugging the API. Pushing through the challenge led me to a deeper understanding of Django RESt Framework and gave me cofidence boost in my developer troubleshooting skills.

### Day 2: August 9, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: Today I earned my SQL Gold badge on HAckerRAnk! I took some time to focus on fundamentals of algorithms and SQL. 

**Thoughts:** I love how algo problems really make you drill down into logic. Regardless of chosen programming language - Euclidean Distance is calculated same the same way. I remember when solving multiple "easy" HackerRank problems in a single session was challenging. Felt good to earn the gold badge with 4 "medium" problems and take the time to really sit with the solutions.

### Day 3: August 10, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: I was contacted about a frontend job using Mapbox and Leaflet. So, I began development on a "Zillow" clone with React frontend, django backend, mapbox and leaflet for listing maps. The app will also connect to a postgres db. The django backend will assigned role-based access for realtors, Admins and users.

**Thoughts:** I am stoked about architecting something that could have a realworld use case and fun to tinker with! The db is not playing nice after install. I will need to reinstall tomorrow and find the source issue. All in all, I am reenergized and having fun coding again.

### Day 4: August 11, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: I got hungup on installing and configuring PostgreSQL. Managed to get unstuck and push through. 
**Thoughts:** I am glad I pushed through to a solution. The bump in the road led me to an even faster work flow via running my Terminal.app command via Alfred, instead of opening the application. However, the solution took longer than planned to find. on a positive note, I am really proud of the architecture considerations of my realtor app and i am happy it is fullstack and allows me to practice all of my developer and DevOps skills.

### Day 5: August 12, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: I got inspired by my Day 4 hangup and stayed up (or got up early) and pressed on the get a couple of meaningful backend changes through. I added the django framework and the accounts app for role-based access. After somee sleep, I added the CORSHEADERS to the realtor app (Zillownaire) necessary for user level access to the database. I also did some algo work in Python on HackerRank.
**Thoughts:** Feeling excited to be inspired enough to stay up late and get up early! 
 I realized I have to be much more aggressive in order to see as many solutions as possible. I have to get over 200 problems to remain competative in the interview process. I also realize I need decent sleep and exercise in order to keep up the ferocity. Learning a lot about CORS safety in Django. really enjoying the framework.
