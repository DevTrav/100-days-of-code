# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 7, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: began work on Django API, worked on url routiung and framework for the app. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with debugging the API not recognizing the rest_framework module, but, overall, I feel like I am getting better at pushing through hurddles. Django is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. Looking forward to diving deeper into Django and geting the API up and running.

### Day 1: August 8, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: Debugged url.py routing issues in Django API, learned new testing technique using views.py to confirm new apps(API in my case) and main app url.py routes are working together. Also, I created a new repo for Exercism algo solutions and pushed my local Excercism install as the initial commit. I also honed some clean git flow for when you need to blowup a local repo and reflect the remote repo upstream --> git reset --hard origin/main. Then, clean untracked files in the local repo with --> git clean -xdf. Very handy.

**Thoughts:** I am really proud that I pushed through the discomfort of struggling with debugging the API. Pushing through the challenge led me to a deeper understanding of Django RESt Framework and gave me cofidence boost in my developer troubleshooting skills.
